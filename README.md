#### Huffman algorithm

Siddahnt Khanna and I worked on this with python at first, then I decided to write the code in rust because I'm currently learning the language. Rust implementation of huffman was difficult mostly because it resembles c/c++ then python or java.
I got the idea how to implement most of the stuff(not the algorithm but the actual rust semantics) from this blog
http://jalexvig.github.io/blog/huffman-coding-rust/.

Thus, I do not claim this code is my own. This code very closely resembles what is given in the blog mostly because I followed the instructions step by step.
